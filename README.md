Virtual Career Fair App
===================================
For this coding assignment, I decided to create a virtual career fair app that matches participants to recruiters based on their job preference.
For example: software engineer, entry level and full time. The reason why I chose this app was because I noticed that all recruiting events have been moved to online format and my virtual career fair app could add a nice touch to Glimpse's quick-video call functionality for career fair purposes. 

## How this Virtual Career Fair App works
Recruiters and participants can sign up with their organization name and choose what kind of jobs/candidates they are looking for. To ensure my app can do fast lookup for the matching processs, I am using bit manipulation technique to represent each indicated job perference.
