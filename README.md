Virtual Career Fair App
===================================
For this coding assignment, I decided to create a virtual career fair app that matches participants to recruiters based on their job preference.
For example: software engineer, entry level and full time. The reason why I chose this app was because I noticed that all recruiting events have been moved to online format and my virtual career fair app could add a nice touch to Glimpse's quick-video call functionality for career fair purposes.
